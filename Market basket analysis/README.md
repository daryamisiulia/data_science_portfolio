# Association Rules for Market Baskets Project

You can find my project [here](http://rpubs.com/d_misiulia/732469).

In this paper considered the associative rules as one of the tools of Data Mining, allowing to effectively process large amounts of data and to find the necessary information. The application of associative rules and, in particular, the Apriori algorithm allows to find rules, on the basis of which it is possible to analyze customer behavior and plan the arrangement of goods. The data obtained on the basis of shopping cart analysis can be used:

* predict which products customers can choose based on what they already have in their baskets;
* offer promotions such as “everyone who buys A and B goods C as a gift”;
* identify the most popular product sets consisting of more than 1 item;
* set up a personalized email newsletter based on frequent product sets for specific users.
