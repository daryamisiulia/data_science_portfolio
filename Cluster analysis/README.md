# Application of cluster analysis for evaluation development of the Polish economy and Dimension Reduction with PCA

Please, find my project [here](http://rpubs.com/d_misiulia/732473). 

The idea of my work is to compare the level of economic development of Polish regions on the basis of the results of cluster analysis and to compare the results of research into different methods of clustering among themselves.

The work consists of two parts. The first part contains information on the analysis of selected economic factors and the inclusion of data for analysis of clusters. The second part presents the application of cluster analysis using R language and the results of the analysis. This chapter contains a description of the presented results of the study, comparison of results of different grouping methods and conclusions concerning the evaluation of economic development of Polish voivodeships. The work closes with a short summary of the research results and conclusions.
