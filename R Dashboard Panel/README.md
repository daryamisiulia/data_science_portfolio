# Shiny Dashboard with EDA and liner regression

This folder contains code and data for the my dashboard project in R.

## Description

The goal of project was to create an application for exploratory data analysis and presentation of simple linear regression, as well as providing basic descriptive statistics for the selected dataset. Since EDA can sometimes be time-consuming due to the sheer number of variables in a data set, writing code for each graph or group of graphs. I decided to eliminate these difficulties and reduce the time for EDA, this application is a simple tool that provides various interactive visualizations used in EDA, with just the click of a button. The application also contains functions for displaying the results of the research regression calculation and its visualization.

The user will be able to choose the type of graph, the variables that will be displayed, it will also be possible to calculate the basic descriptive statistics for the columns, save the resulting graphs, as well as change the dataset.
